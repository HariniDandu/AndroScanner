Nowadays, there exists a mobile application for every feature from ordering a coffee to monitoring bank accounts. Backends at these mobile applications provide various functionalities such as content delivery, analytics, ad networks, telemetry, and more for the daily maintenance of the apps. These functionalities are mainly delivered by the APIs. Unfortunately, application developers are unaware or have no control over the security practices when choosing or managing these services. The mobile applications using these backends are in turn installed by millions of users potentially affecting thousands of them. These exposed backend vulnerabilities can be used by attackers to compromise the mobile backend, which can result in leaking user data, deleting application content, or injecting malicious code. It is necessary to analyze these mobile appsâ€™ backends and provide actionable remediation to the application developers. This paper presents AndroScanner, a pipeline for vetting the backends that mobile applications interact with and providing actionable remedies.
